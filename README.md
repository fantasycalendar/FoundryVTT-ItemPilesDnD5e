## What is Item Piles?

Have you ever wished you could represent items in your scenes? A pile of items, something to interact with - or perhaps
chests whose appearance changes depending on what happens to it, whether it's open, closed, full, or empty. Do you want
an easy way to split loot between players? Do you want easy to use merchants with great UIs?

[Then you need **Item Piles**!](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/item-piles)

## What is this?

This is a module that enables the D&D5e Foundry system to work seamlessly with Item Piles.
